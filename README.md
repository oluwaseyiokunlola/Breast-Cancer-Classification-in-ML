# Breast-Cancer-Classification-in-ML
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to classify breast cancer tumors as malignant or benign using diagnostic features. The goal is to assist early detection by applying a supervised learning approach.  A Logistic Regression model was trained and evaluated using the Breast Cancer dataset available in scikit-learn.
